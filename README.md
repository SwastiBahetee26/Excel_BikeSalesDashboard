# Bike Sales Data Analysis with Excel

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing and visualizing bike sales data using Excel. The data, provided in a CSV file, contains information about different customers and the vehicles they own. The objective is to filter the data based on various criteria such as education, marital status, and more. We then create pivot tables and design a dashboard for easy filtering and data analysis.

## Data Source

The project begins with a CSV file containing raw sales data:

- **Sales.csv** - Contains customer information and details about the vehicles they own.

The data was originally provided by the YouTuber [Alex The Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/c/AlexTheAnalyst) and is available on his [GitHub repository](https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst).

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Import and Preparation**:
   - Import the `sales.csv` file into Excel.
   - Clean and prepare the data, ensuring all entries are consistent and ready for analysis.

2. **Data Filtering**:
   - Use Excelâ€™s filtering capabilities to sort and analyze data based on criteria like:
     - **Education**: Filter customers based on their level of education.
     - **Marital Status**: Segment the data according to marital status.
     - Additional filters such as income level, vehicle type, etc.

3. **Pivot Tables**:
   - Create pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data, making it easier to analyze trends and patterns.
   - Examples of pivot tables include:
     - **Sales by Education Level**: Analyze how education affects purchasing behavior.
     - **Vehicle Ownership by Marital Status**: Determine trends in vehicle ownership among different marital statuses.

4. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Design an interactive dashboard using Excel, integrating the pivot tables and filters.
   - The dashboard allows users to dynamically filter the data and view results in a visually appealing format.
   - This dashboard is stored in the final Excel file, providing an intuitive interface for data exploration.

## Final Output

- **BikeSalesDashboard.xlsx** - The final Excel file containing the pivot tables and the interactive dashboard for filtering and analyzing the bike sales data.

## How to Use

1. **Open the Final Dashboard**:
   - Open the `BikeSalesDashboard.xlsx` file in Excel.

2. **Interact with the Dashboard**:
   - Use the built-in filters and pivot tables to explore the data.
   - The dashboard allows you to analyze the bike sales data by different criteria, providing insights into customer behavior and sales trends.
